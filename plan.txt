Fullstack JS

1. Grab GitHub data
   Idea: Frooty Tree
   We literally draw a tree that spawns fruit based on commits
   -Commits          : Branch nodes
   -Lines changed    : Fruit colour
   -Classes changed  : Fruits
   -Branches         : Branches
   -Merges           : Flowers; Only possible if commit message references a merge
   -Contributor

   Alternative: Fyre Werk
   - We shoot Fireworks up into the sky based on commits and stuff

2. Parse data into data structure
   -List of sequential commit objects

3. Render
   -D3.js
